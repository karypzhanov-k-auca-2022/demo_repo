The summer is over, I missed it, barrel with smoke, and I kissed it
Ferris showed us the renders for Texas, it's unrealistic
Cut 'em the check 'cause I hate reviewin' the budgets and limits
Just pay the man

The world fell in love with the gimmicks, even my brothers got tickets
Seemed like they loved every minute
